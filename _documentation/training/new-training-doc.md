## Description

This is a new entry.

## Instructions

New training entry with some things and stuff and such:

1. Here's a step
2. And here's another step
3. Look! A third step

Now here are some more instructions. And eventually there will be some pictures to go with the steps above, but for now you'll just have to use your imagination!

Now let's see what a bulleted list looks like:

* Here's a bulleted step
* There's a bulleted step
* Bulleted steps are everywhere

Maybe I'll throw in another list for good measure. Wouldn't want this entry to be too short.

Another list of things:

1. Thing one
2. Thing two

Now this sounds like a Dr. Seuss story!

Ok, that's enough training doc information for now.

The End
